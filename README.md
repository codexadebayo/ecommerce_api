## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

* **Python**: Python 3.10 or higher is required.
* **PostgreSQL**: A PostgreSQL database server is required.
* **Git**: Git is required for version control.
* **Docker (Optional)**: Docker is recommended for containerized deployment.

### 2.2. Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git)
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2.3. Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into the `.env` file and modify the values to match your environment.

    ```
    PROJECT_NAME="E-commerce API"
    API_V1_STR="/api/v1"
    SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"  # Change this!
    ALGORITHM="HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
    DB_HOST="localhost"
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USER="your_db_user"
    DB_PASS="your_db_password"  # Keep this secure!
    DB_NAME="your_db_name"
    BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8080"]  # Add your frontend origins
    EMAIL_FROM="your_email@example.com"
    BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```

### 2.4. Running the Application

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and configured.
2.  Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

    * `--reload`:  Enable auto-reloading for development.
    * `--host 0.0.0.0`:  Listen on all network interfaces.
    * `--port 8000`:  Specify the port to listen on.

## 3. API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger UI.  Once the application is running, you can access it at:

    http://localhost:8000/docs

    (Replace `localhost:8000` with your application's domain or address).

## 4. Database Setup

1.  Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running.
2.  Create a database with the name specified in your `.env` file (`DB_NAME`).
3.  SQLAlchemy will create the database tables automatically when the application starts.  Make sure that the database user you provide in the `.env` file has the necessary permissions to create tables.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

* The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
* Users can register and log in to obtain an access token.
* The access token is included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.
* The API also implements authorization to control access to specific resources based on user roles or permissions (Not implemented in the current code).

## 6. Password Security

* The API uses Argon2 for password hashing, a modern and secure hashing algorithm.
* Passwords are never stored in plain text.
* The `check_password_strength` function ensures that user-provided passwords meet the minimum security requirements.

## 7. Input Validation

* Pydantic schemas are used to validate all incoming request data.
* This ensures that the API receives data in the expected format and prevents errors caused by invalid input.
* Clear and informative error messages are returned to the client for validation failures.

## 8. Error Handling

* The API implements global exception handling to catch and handle errors consistently.
* Custom exception classes are used to provide specific error messages and HTTP status codes.
* Error responses are formatted as JSON for easy consumption by clients.

## 9. Logging

* The application uses Python's `logging` module to log events and errors.
* Logs are configured to provide detailed information for debugging and monitoring.
* Logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) are used to categorize log messages.

## 10. Caching

* **(Not Implemented in the provided code, but recommended)**
* For production, consider implementing a caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to improve performance.
* Cache frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the database.

## 11. Background Tasks

* **(Not Fully Implemented in the provided code, but outlined)**
* FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` can be used for tasks that do not need to be performed immediately, such as sending emails or processing data.

## 12. Security Best Practices

* **HTTPS**:  Ensure that your API is served over HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.
* **Input Sanitization**:  Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.  (Pydantic helps with this)
* **CORS**:  Configure CORS carefully to allow only trusted origins to access your API.
* **Rate Limiting**:  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits**:  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
* **Dependency Management**:  Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Secure File Storage**:  If your application handles file uploads, ensure that files are stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.
* **Error Handling**:  Avoid returning sensitive information in error messages.
* **Data Encryption**:  Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., credit card information) using appropriate encryption algorithms.
* **Regularly Rehash Passwords**: Implement a strategy to rehash passwords periodically.

## 13. Testing

* The application includes a comprehensive suite of tests.
* Use `pytest` to run the tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

* Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
* Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the application.
* Use a testing database to isolate tests from your production data.
